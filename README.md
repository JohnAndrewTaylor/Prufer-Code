# Prüfer Code
My algorithms and programs on Prüfer encoding and decoding

My first exposure to Prüfer codes was in my Applied Combinatorics class at the Georgia Institute of Technology with Professor Croot. The code system was shown to our class as part of the proof for Cayley's Formula during our discussion on labeled trees. I was fascinated by the idea of having an entire tree represented with a simple series of numbers, especially since it only required n-2 numbers for n vertices! As a Computer Science student, I immediately felt compelled to write a computer program for encoding/decoding Prüfer codes.

As a challenge, I decided to try to create an efficient algorithm for decoding Prüfer codes without referencing other sources. After my code was running correctly, I started researching other people's work and noticed that our algorithms or preferred data structures differed. I am currently running tests to assess the speed of my method compared to other publicly known algorithms.
